	<h2>who?</h2>
	<h3>me. trevor :)</h3>
	<p>I'm a designer of many kinds, living and working in Portland, OR. Most of the time I'm designing lighting, scenery, projections,
		and a ton of other stuff for the local theatres in town. You can find all that stuff
		<a href="trevorsargent.me">here</a>.
	</p>

	<p>When I'm not on a ladder or drafting, I'm flipping bits back and forth learning a ton and making (hopefully) some cool things
		for your screen to show you. These days it's mainly web things. I like making stuff that's easy to show people and maybe
		even somewhat useful for those that need it.</p>
