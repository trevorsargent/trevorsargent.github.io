			<h3>me. trevor :)</h3>
			<p>
				I'm a designer of many kinds, living and working in Portland, OR. Some of the time I'm designing
				lighting, scenery, projections,
				and a ton of other things for the local theatres... You can find all of that stuff
				<a href="http://trevorsargent.me">here</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				I take great pride in creating
				individual solutions across many disciplines. I've collected some of my favorite
				web-ready projects from the past few years for you here. Enjoy!
