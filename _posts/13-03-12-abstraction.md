i have been experimenting with abstraction in my photo work. so far, i'm just having fun seeing what sort of blur things can have, where they become unrecognizable. sometimes it doesn't matter, sometimes the subject can still come through, and it is those pictures where the subject is just familiar enough that we can tell what it is, but obscured to the point where nothing but the characteristics are left that really seem to grab my artistic eye.
