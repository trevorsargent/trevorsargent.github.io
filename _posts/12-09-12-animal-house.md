many many people tried to tell me what to expect when moving to college. they hit most of the highlights, but there were some over-estimations and some shocking omissions.

they did tell me that i was going to have to share a bathroom with all the guys on my floor, (not as big a deal as you might think) but they didn't tell me is that there would be people taking showers to the tune of "to the windooooooooooowww to the wall (to the wall) to the sweat drop down my..." yeah.

they did tell me that i would have to share a room with one or two or three people, but they did not tell me that they could be so nice, and just be gone all the time

they did tell me that i was going to have to make my own bed (thanks mom, i've been doing this for years) but they didn't tell me that if i chose to "loft" mine, i'd have to make it from underneath (as it's hard to walk around in the air around your bed to make it, and even harder to make it while sitting on it hoping you i don't whack my head agains the ceiling).

they did tell me to eat. i am eating.

they did tell me i would "have to be careful, because you'll have a lot of 'unstructured' time on your hands" but they didn't tell me just how much.

they did tell me i would have a good time. this is where they were the most wrong. i am having anÂ excellent time, and i expect that to continue :)
