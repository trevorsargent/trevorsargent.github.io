i've always felt the same way about writing a review of the year before the year is actually out as i do about having ones birthday party the weekend before ones birthday, i.e., slightly like it's cheating. so here we are on january 4th, and it's time to review 2012. this actually presents another problem, because i don't think it's fair to try to cram an entire year into a single post. i can't even comprehend just how many opportunities i've had to have a seriously awesome (in the most literal sense of the word, awe - inspiring) experience this year. unfortunately, however, not all the things that happened to me last year were of the happy nature; there were serious disruptions in the health of some family members and friends, and our lives are forever changed. i will however, in the context of this post, focus more on the more positive side of this year.

january

saw the tour de nerdfighting, along with the release of the fault in our stars - one of my new mosts favorite books - a heart-wrenching young adult novel about living and loving with and in spite of horrible terminal diseases.

february

was another month of firsts, in terms of latitude. i toured new zealand (north island: auckland, hastings, and wellington) with the san francisco youth eurythmy troupe. this was my third and last tour with that group, (france and china, 2010, and 2011 respectively for the other two) and it blew me completely away. never have i had such a warm welcome or formed such lasting friendships in such a short time (2 to 3 days), though knowing that would see them again in july (see below) definitely helped.

march

included the last show i would work on at my high school as a student of the same. we put on a wonderful production of you can't take it with you, and it served as a last as a wonderful farewell to the drama program that i had worked so closely with for so long.

april

was a busy month. on april first i found myself in the middle nowhere. i still to this day not know exactly where i was (let me explain). i was on a vision quest - my school's phys-ed program offers seniors the opportunity for their spring break to include 72 hours alone and without food in the wilderness armed only with a journal, sunscreen, and water. those days were the most difficult thing i have ever made myself do,(second only perhaps to the 5 sit ups i did the other day :p), but i was incredibly surprised at my ability to pull through, and i am definitely stronger because of it.  also in april i completed the seemingly endless college application process. it culminated with college visit trip number 3 to the northwest. over nights at both lewis and clark college in portland, and university of puget pound in tacoma, almost made my decision for me, and within the week after i was home, my deposit was in the mail to 0615 palatine hill rd, the address i would know and love as l&c!

may

oh goodness may. i barely remember may. so many things. amid my family turmoil, and all that's mentioned above, i had been working on my "senior project", a traditional assignment for seniors at my school, to prepare and present on some topic that involves year long involvement. presentations were everywhere from "the making of a kimono" and "the making of a gauss cannon" to "joining an ngo" and mine "adventures of the self taught photographer". that out of the way, and senior year almost over, only one last standardized test (ap calc), a trip to redding to view the annular solar eclipse, prom, and a few assignments remained till the absolute freedom of the summer that was about to take place. all of the above, a trip to colorado to visit family over memorial day, and a class trip to mexico brought us into

june.

GRADUATION! (and i never use capitals!) the beginning of summer was amazing. i dont think i have spent that much time just enjoying friends all at once ever. i was working here and there to fund july, and saying goodbye to people who would be gone once i got back from july and august (see below). the premiere of brave, and a road trip to the redwoods north of eureka brought

july.

if i had to pick the shortest single month of the year, it might be july, though october is very close. on july 7th (and the 8th) i flew to berlin for a month of [what moves you?](http://whatmovesyou.de), a month long youth eurythmy project/conference to prepare beethoven's 5th symphony, and "fratres" by arvo pärt. i got to meet up with both people from school, people i had met in new zealand, and meet many new people! one of the people from my school, rachel,wrote an [extensive post about the project](http://rachelannpierce.wordpress.com/2012/08/14/thoughts-on-what-moves-you/) that i suggest you read. i tried to write about it, but as you will find from her post, it's a difficult thing to write about, coherently or at all. in a word, whirlwind. in two words, totally awesome. in more, it was four weeks of long days of very physically strenuous rehearsal, and 4 weekends of bonding with new and old friends in an amazing city. rehearsals, and fun lead up to 2 performances in

august.

it's almost hard for me to believe that the beginning of august and the end of august were actually both in august. until the 5th, i was in berlin, still participating in [what moves you?](http://www.whatmovesyou.de), performing in front of hundreds of people, then i got to go to [amsterdam](http://scriptogr.am/trevorsargent/post/meanwhile-on-a-canal) as a [leaping off point](http://scriptogr.am/trevorsargent/post/why-wouldnt-you-want-to-drown) for a [cruise](http://scriptogr.am/trevorsargent/post/fly-me-to-the-moon-or-yet-another-attempt-to-explain-cruising) to [norway](http://scriptogr.am/trevorsargent/post/put-a-goat-on-it-or-a-guide-to-traditional-norwegian-architecture) and then finally, after being away from home for the longest time yet, back to san francisco. but not for long. i think i had 5 or 6 days before i packed up again, on a train to [portland](http://scriptogr.am/trevorsargent/post/land-of-many-initialisms), for the first of 8 semesters at lewis and clark college. i was in 4 different countries, and 8 or 9 different cities.

september

brought rain, a visit or two from a friend or two, and getting into the swing of college life which continued fairly consistently into

october

november

(aside from a quick visit to colorado for thanksgiving), and

december.

needless to say, traveling, and adventures slowed down quite a bit during the fall months, as did writing and photographing. which is what leads me here. whilst in colorado (once again) for christmas, i resolved that starting in 2013 i would write almost every day, planning to post about once a week. which means i need to have a good photo to go with those posts, which means more photo walks. and more walks in general. also sit-ups. you see how these things just sort of get out of hand.

so that was 2012, or at least some of it. hoping for even more fun in 2013 (hawaii, and the mediterranean this summer, and who knows what spring break will bring!
