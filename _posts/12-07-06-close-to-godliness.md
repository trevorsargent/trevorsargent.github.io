i'm not going to pretend that i fully understand the existence of the higgs boson, but i can appreciate that it's the most important scientific discovery in 50-100 years (maybe not that long, but bear with me). i'm very excited that they found it, or, are very very almost very sure that they found it (99.95% on a test is good enough for me, but i get it... still might not be it) but i have two slight complaints.

1: this particle is predicted by the "standard model", a theory that is standard in name only, and this discovery would seem to point to the fact that we may, as a species, have figured out a good chunk of why we're here to begin with. but it leaves little mystery. ok that might be a bit of an over simplification, but you get the idea

2: this, and this is the worst one, is the media's ludicrous latching on to the mention of this as called "the god particle". i personally have no problem what so ever with people having faith. but i dont think that people should claim a scientific discovery as part of their own religion. i think it was a scientist who originally coined the name, but people have definitely taken the bait and run with it. to entwine this discovery with some religion makes me crazy. i know i will probably alienate some people by saying that, but it's my truth.
