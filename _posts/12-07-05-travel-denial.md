i'm doing that thing that i do. when i go into complete denial about the fact that i'm leaving the country within 2 days. tomorrow i will be leaving tomorrow for 7 weeks, and i haven't even started thinking about what i need to pack. i have my passport, and i'm waiting on a new camera lens (more on that soon) and it should all come together, it usually does, but i'm in bit of a limbo right now. don't get me wrong, i'm extremely excited to go, and i realize that i'm very lucky to be able to go on this trip with my friends, and then my family (berlin, and norway respectively), but i just haven't actually come to the realization that it's real - that i will in fact be going. for me this is partially because of all the upheaval i've had this year. i'm beginning to realize that nothing is for sure going to happen until its happening, or has already happened. i will believe it when i'm on the berlin subway, exploring the city, as i am want to do. i will know when i am inevitable yelled at for not being able to load my ticket fast enough, that i have found the common ground between cities (mean people on public transportation), and i will feel at home!
