I have often mentioned to the person near me, when the thought strikes me every few weeks or so, that we are living at the beginning of the most-well-documented era of history.  With the addition of personal location- and time-aware devices to our every-day on-body inventory, we not only able, but constantly taking advantage of the ability to document more about the day to day life than has ever been recorded.  I first gave this more than a few seconds of thought when I watched the documentary produced by YouTube, [Life in a Day](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=JaFVr_cJJIY), for the first time.  On YouTube alone, one hour of video is uploaded every second; that is, our experience of our planet is being logged at a rate of 1:3600 experience to record.
