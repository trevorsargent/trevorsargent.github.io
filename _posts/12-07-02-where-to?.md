the place: berlin  
the project: [What Moves You](http://whatmovesyou.de)

i will be in berlin for a month working on a project, and that project, i will describe for you now. this year is the 100th anniversary of eurythmy (more on that later), and this summer (in berlin) there is a conference for youth 17-23. we will be rehearsing beethoven's 5th symphony and pärt's 'fratres' by day, and exploring and destroying berlin by night. im extremely excited to work with 79 of my fellow youth on this project. i actually was able to meet a few of them on my performing troupe's trip to new zealand, and i'm looking very much forward to meeting all the others. from there i'll be traveling to amsterdam for a few days, and then on to norway for a family vacation. look forward to many pictures (some here, some here) and more updates.
