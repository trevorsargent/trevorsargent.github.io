so, i start college tomorrow. no big deal. actually, i have been here for a week already (ok, 5 days) but still. i have my first official college course at 1:50 pm tomorrow. smile for me...   i was thinking today about how when i was taking a class to prep for the sat, that the overly hyper teacher dude said "just think, once you get to that big blinky sign that is college, you can make your schedule so that you don't have any classes before the crack of noon!" i did not believe him. fast forward about a year and a half, and branden, you were right. almost, i have a 10:20 class monday, wednesday, friday, but anyway, a lot better than 8:15 am. i have been roaming around campus since last wednesday, being lectured at about how awesome college is, which i knew already, that is why i'm here, and how to lead a health and safe life here at college, and what kinds of classes i need to make sure to take, even though registration was mostly over by then, and how all of the various organizations on campus are going to benefit me in the near and far future. mostly i'm just happy that i'm going to be receiving an excellent education over the next 4 years, and that i get to live on the (this year it's the) 5th most beautiful college campus in the country.
