it might be a little weird to say that i miss the snow, as i might not have very much to back me</div>

<div>up. as i noted, quite emphatically in my post about fall, i have never lived in a place with actual winter until now, and i seem to have left for all of the exciting bits. but this is surprisingly unrelated. as interesting as snow is, snow that actually exists in reality is not nearly as interesting as some of the snow that people can create in their brains - specifically mathematically defined, fractionally dimensional line-shapes.</div>

<div>consider the koch snowflake. let me back up. consider fractals. some of these are shapes that come with a base and a set of instructions for how to make the next iteration based on the previous shape. back to the koch snowflake. this one starts with an equilateral triangle. and the rule is that for every side, center the base a smaller equilateral triangle one third the size on each side of the previous shape. this very simple fractal curve is something that you are probably familiar with if you have ever taken anything called "math in nature" (o.o) or "math in the real world" or "calculus and chaos" or "youtube with vihart". the result after the first iteration is a six pointed star, but after that it gets a bit more interesting. it begins to curve around itself, creating a shape much like a snowflake. these are all very beautiful and and all that, but it gets very interesting what happens when you start to scale them. if you keep track of how much "stuff" (line length, line "area", string-you-would-need-to-make-it) makes it up when you scale it, you find that it exists in a somewhat "fractionally dimensional" space. let me explain. take, for example, a line. if you were to scale it up by 3,
