i've always marveled at the flexibility of time. i'm glad science is right there with me.Â this year i finally gave up time keeping. i stuck with clock-keeping though, that's what keeps deadlines. but i finally let myself realize that the ultra-accurate way in which we keep time does not at all indicate how much happens in that time, nor does in appropriately represent how "long" that unit of time is in our experience of it. very full hours ticked by quickly, leading one thing right into the next. but by the end of that day, the beginning of that day seemed an eternity away. but each day, in my mind, was short - they just rolled by - and it kept being sunday. over and over again.



i've been in school at lewis and clark for almost a year. somehow, in the midst of the papers, the homework, the classes, and the countless hours spent in the theater, 8 months have ticked by. in august, upon my arrival, the entirety of the 2 freshman semesters ahead of me was an endless expanse waiting to be filled in with seemingly foreign activities. quickly i was swallowed by the wealth of possibilities, and days started to disappear.



and then it was april...



i wanted it to last.



but it flew



"time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana"



personally i think time flies more like a banana than anything else...
