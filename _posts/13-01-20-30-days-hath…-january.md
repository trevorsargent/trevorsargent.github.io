i'm going back to school tomorrow. back to portland. back to the bubble of college life that operates on a fake currency.

it has been, as "time machine" so kindly reminds me, 30 days since i've backed up, 30 days since portland, 30 days that i've been home.

one third family, one third home, one third friends. though not divided evenly, my time here has been spent reminding the people i love who live south of ashland that i do still exist, that "yes, i love where i am" and that i intend to stay there. secretly i'm wishing all along that they would just leave me the hell alone about it. you know it's fine, and i'd tell you if it wasn't, just let me enjoy my time at home.

as mentioned several times, the period of nearly 4 months from late august to the end of december was the longest that i had been away from san francisco all at once, and the next 4 will be second only to that. which leaves just 4 left for being not in portland. 4 months in which i must travel, catch up with old friends so they don't drift too far, visit family, and assure them that yes i'm alive.

i will be sad to leave san francisco again, it is, and will forever be my home. i could not ask for a finer place to call home either. and i will miss it.
