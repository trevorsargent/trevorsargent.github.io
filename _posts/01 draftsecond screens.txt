let me just start off with the fact that i am definitely guilty of all that i am about to ridicule and complain about. i am a child of a technological era, and am excited, nay, intrigued by the possibilities and opportunities that recent developments in technology offer. with this intrigue comes a desire to learn about, and keep up with the innovations and inventions in the tech-world, i do a fair bit of consuming of tech-news podcasts: round-table discussions of the newest products, interesting applications of old technology, etc.
