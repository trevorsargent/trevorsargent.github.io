this time last year was important.

this time last year, i had no current place of education. i had ended my 13 year stint at the school in which i had been enrolled each and every day of my life since i was 5 years old.  i was at sea.  at that time, the shape of my daily life in the coming 4 years was completely foreign to me, and i was scared out of my mind. scared, but at the same time incredibly excited.  not a month earlier, i had been checking off, one by one, the necessary requirements for graduation from my highschool: turn in all library books, complete all outstanding work, light one final play for the drama club, spend a few days bonding with my class on our senior trip, and start saying some very reluctant and drawn-out goodbyes. there was no way to predict who i would actually stay in contact with. i knew i would lose some people, and i knew that i would maintain a connection with others, but the sets of people that fell into each category would completely surprise me over the year to come. i signed the yearbooks of those that asked, and asked those that i cared about to sign mine. and finally, i walked across the stage, and shook hands with the president of the board of directors as he handed my my diploma. 

this time last year was the happiest and the saddest time of my life all rolled into one: the end of something familiar, and the start of something wonderful.
