in an ongoing exploration with abstraction, i looked across some scans of an old film roll, and ran across these images. they are the scans of the end of the roll, the tail end, the part people put their fingers all over whilst loading the camera. it sparked an idea that, for me, comes from [eurythmy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurythmy) - '[schwung](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Schwung)' (ˈʃvʊŋ) - the space inbetween movements. the concept inherent in 'schwung' is that the space inbetween two events needs attention too. that there is an acceleration into the next event. 

the best way i can think of to describe this in more concrete terms, is to descibe a mechanical set up. picture a springloaded hammer, primed to strike a bell. the hammer has a release trigger, so that when pressed, the hammer swings and strikes the bell. to two main events are the triggereing of the hammer, and the sound of the hammer striking the bell. the schwung, is the energy, the momentum, or motion of the hammer from the moment it is released, up until it strikes the bell. it is fast, it is light, and it is equally if not more important than either of the two 'main' events. 

in eurythmy, this is more of an advanced concept, but i try to apply it as a way of thinking, which is how it found it's place in film photography.  these are the images of what comes inbetween pictures, in between rolls. they are an image of the mechanism that allows for the capture of the intentional pictures, the motion in between them... the schwung.
