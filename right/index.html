			<p>I'm currently a student of theatrical design and technical theater.* I'm perpetually excited about coming up with new ideas and solutions to new and old plays/shows. I have some experience with theatrical lighting: I designed my college's "One Act Festival" this fall (2013), and I worked on many shows prior to that in my highshool career. I'm always thinking up random things in the middle of the night with no idea what show they are for, but I've included some of those ideas and sketches, in addition to my acutal portfolio, here.  </p>

			<p>I'm am amature photographer. I first got behind the lens a few years ago (about 5 I think) and I havn't stopped sense. I shoot for for, because things around me are beautiful, and to hone my craft. I have no claims to fame in this category... maybe soon.</p>

			<p>My writing is purely for me. In the past year, I've been writing for The College Theater Blog, but my short essays and brain ramblings are monstly mine. They're here if you wish to peruse them.</p>
