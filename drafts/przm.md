Half a way for me to learn React & Vue.js (I wrote it twice), and half a way to wrap my head around the organization of the new very large set of Prismacolor markers I had just been gifted, przm is a personalized marker catalog tool. It lets you view all the available sets, displaying the name and a color chip (with the hex code for each color only a click away!).
