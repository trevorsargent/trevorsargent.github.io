		<p>I recognized that I had an interest in capturing images of the world around me at an early age. I bought myself my first 'real camera' in 10th grade, and I've been shooting up a storm ever since.  I considder myself purely a hobbyist, but I am asked from time to time to photograph various subjects, and for this I am very greatful. </p>

		<h2><a href="/blog">Blog</a></h2>
		<p>My writing is a bit of everything.  It's a travel journal, musings on my development as an artist (pun intended), and essays on seemingly random but actually totally related topics. </p>

		<h2>Why Dither?</h2>
		<p>I've always felt that my life is split; I've never been able to choose between paths.  It used to cause me great anguish to think that some day I would have to choose between two things that I love, but recently I have realized that it is up to me to find a way to combine them both, and maintain my love for each. </p>
