[The Doctor and the Devil](http://trevorsargent.me/2018/01/18/the-doctor-and-the-devil.html) was one of the first peer-produced projects I worked on out of school. A group of my friends and I got together and produced a devised work based on Faustian mythology and Heideggerian philosophy. By way of summary, it strove to challenge the public's notion of consumerism and 'revealing' things in the world as resources, ordering the world into heirarchy's of usefulness. 

This was an early visual contribution to the body of work from which we drew material for the production.
